# Economic Impact Study on Singapore

## Project Outline

### 1. Project Definition
- **Research Question**: Assessing the impact of two economic superpowers on Singapore's economy.
- **Hypothesis**: One or both of these superpowers have a significant impact on specific aspects of Singapore's economy.

### 2. Data Collection
- Collect relevant time-series data for Singapore and the superpowers (GDP, trade volumes, investment flows, etc.).
- Data should cover a sufficient time span for long-term trends.

### 3. Data Preparation
- Check for data quality and completeness.
- Standardize data format for time-series analysis.

### 4. Preliminary Analysis
- Conduct descriptive statistics and visual data inspection.

### 5. Stationarity Testing
- Use tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller for stationarity.
- Apply differencing or transformation if necessary.

### 6. Cointegration Testing (for VEC Model)
- Use Johansen test for cointegration in non-stationary data.
- Indicates long-term equilibrium relationships.

### 7. Model Specification
- Choose appropriate lag lengths based on AIC/BIC.
- Specify VAR for stationary and VEC for cointegrated series.

### 8. Causality Testing
- Conduct Granger causality tests to investigate causal relationships.

### 9. Model Estimation
- Estimate VAR/VEC models and interpret coefficients.

### 10. Diagnostic Checking
- Check for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and model stability.

### 11. Advanced Analysis
- Impulse response analysis and variance decomposition.

### 12. Interpretation and Reporting
- Interpret results in context and discuss implications.

### 13. Conclusions
- Draw conclusions and discuss limitations and future research areas.

### 14. Documentation
- Document all steps, methodologies, and findings.

## Analysis Approach

- **Quantitative Analysis**: Quantify impacts using VAR, VEC, and causality tests.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the influence of each superpower.
- **Contextual Interpretation**: Interpret findings within broader economic context.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Evaluate findings considering data constraints and model assumptions.

## Final Steps

- **Peer Review**: Have methodology and findings reviewed.
- **Publication/Presentation**: Share findings effectively.
- **Update Based on Feedback**: Revise analysis if necessary.
