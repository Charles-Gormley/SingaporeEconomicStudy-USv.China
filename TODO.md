* [x] Fix Heatmap 
* [x] Figure out how to do this comparative analysis
* [x] Autocorrelation
* [ ] Add dummy variables (exogenous)
* [ ] Crisis Dummy Variables
* [x] Multicollinearity
* [ ] Error Bars with Impulse 
* [ ] Significance of Impulse response

* [ ] Plan out ARDL Model

1. Testing Cointegration Engle Granger [How do I choose which variable is dependent.] For each non-stationary variable.

2. VAR Model lag tests
3. VAR Model granger causality test
4. Running Final VAR Model
5. Impulse Response
6. Vector Decomposition.

7. ARDL
